## How to Use This Book

Each puzzle maintains a consistent structure to support systematic skill development:

- **Overview**: Problem definition and key concepts for each challenge
- **Configuration**: Technical setup and memory organization details
- **Code to Complete**: Implementation framework in `problems/pXX/` with clearly marked sections to fill in
- **Tips**: Strategic hints available when needed, without revealing complete solutions
- **Solution**: Comprehensive implementation analysis, including performance considerations and conceptual explanations

The puzzles increase in complexity systematically, building new concepts on established foundations. Working through them sequentially is recommended, as advanced puzzles assume familiarity with concepts from earlier challenges.

## Running the code

All puzzles integrate with a testing framework that validates implementations against expected results. Each puzzle provides specific execution instructions and solution verification procedures.

## Prerequisites

### System requirements

Make sure your system meets our [system requirements](https://docs.modular.com/max/packages#system-requirements).

### Compatible GPU

You'll need a [compatible GPU](https://docs.modular.com/max/faq#gpu-requirements) to run the puzzles. After setup, you can verify your GPU compatibility using the `gpu-specs` command (see Quick Start section below).

#### macOS Apple Sillicon (Early preview)

For `osx-arm64` users, you'll need:

- **macOS 15.0 or later** for optimal compatibility. Run `pixi run check-macos` and if it fails you'd need to upgrade.
- **Xcode 16 or later** (minimum required). Use `xcodebuild -version` to check.

If `xcrun -sdk macosx metal` outputs `cannot execute tool 'metal' due to missing Metal toolchain` proceed by running

```bash
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain
```

and then `xcrun -sdk macosx metal`, should give you the `no input files error`.

> **Note**: Currently the puzzles 1-8 and 11-15 are working on macOS. We're working to enable more. Please stay tuned!

### Programming knowledge

Basic knowledge of:

- Programming fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)
- Parallel computing concepts (threads, synchronization, race conditions)
- Basic familiarity with [Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/) (language basics parts and [intro to pointers](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/pointers/) section)
- [GPU programming fundamentals](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/gpu/fundamentals) is helpful!

No prior GPU programming experience is necessary! We'll build that knowledge through the puzzles.

Let's begin our journey into the exciting world of GPU computing with Mojo🔥!

    - Full conda + PyPI ecosystem support

    > **Note: Some puzzles only work with `pixi`**

    **Install:**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
    ```

    **Update:**

    ```bash
    pixi self-update
    ```

   #### **Option 2**: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

    **Install:**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    **Update:**

    ```bash
    uv self update
    ```

    **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

## Working with puzzles

### Project structure

- **[`problems/`](https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles/tree/main/problems)**: Where you implement your solutions (this is where you work!)
- **[`solutions/`](https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles/tree/main/solutions)**: Reference solutions for comparison and learning that we use throughout the book

### Workflow

1. Navigate to `problems/pXX/` to find the puzzle template
2. Implement your solution in the provided framework
3. Test your implementation: `pixi run pXX` or `uv run poe pXX` (remember to include your platform with `-e platform` such as `-e amd`)
4. Compare with `solutions/pXX/` to learn different approaches

- Tesla V100 (limited availability)

**Limitations for Mojo GPU Puzzles:**

- **Older GPU architecture**: T4 GPUs may have limited compatibility with advanced Mojo GPU features
- **Session limits**: 12-hour maximum runtime, then automatic disconnect
- **Limited debugging support**: NVIDIA debugging tools (puzzles 9-10) may not be fully available
- **Package installation restrictions**: May require workarounds for Mojo/MAX installation
- **Performance limitations**: Shared infrastructure affects consistent benchmarking

**Recommended for:** Basic GPU programming concepts (puzzles 1-8, 11-15) and learning fundamental patterns.

#### **Kaggle Notebooks**

Kaggle offers more generous free GPU access:

**Available GPUs:**

- Tesla T4 (30 hours per week free)
- P100 (limited availability)

**Advantages over Colab:**

- **More generous time limits**: 30 hours per week compared to Colab's daily session limits
- **Better persistence**: Notebooks save automatically
- **Consistent environment**: More reliable package installation

**Limitations for Mojo GPU Puzzles:**

- **Same GPU architecture constraints**: T4 compatibility issues with advanced features
- **Limited debugging tools**: NVIDIA profiling and debugging tools (puzzles 9-10, 30-32) unavailable
- **Mojo installation complexity**: Requires manual setup of Mojo environment
- **No cluster programming support**: Advanced puzzles (33-34) won't work

**Recommended for:** Extended learning sessions on fundamental GPU programming (puzzles 1-16).

### Recommendations

- **Complete Learning Path**: Use NVIDIA GPU for full curriculum access (all 34 puzzles)
- **Comprehensive Learning**: AMD GPUs work well for most content (27 of 34 puzzles)
- **Basic Understanding**: Apple GPUs suitable for fundamental concepts (13 of 34 puzzles)
- **Free Platform Learning**: Google Colab/Kaggle suitable for basic to intermediate concepts (puzzles 1-16)
- **Debugging & Profiling**: NVIDIA GPU required for debugging tools and performance analysis
- **Modern GPU Features**: NVIDIA GPU required for Tensor Cores and cluster programming
